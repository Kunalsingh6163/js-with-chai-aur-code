What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage
LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when the browser 
is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.

How do you access web storage
The Window object implements the WindowLocalStorage and WindowSessionStorage objects which has localStorage(window.localStorage) and sessionStorage(window.sessionStorage) properties respectively. These properties create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed for a specific domain and storage type (session or local). For example, you can read and write on local storage objects as below

localStorage.setItem("logo", document.getElementById("logo").value);
localStorage.getItem("logo");


What are the methods available on session storage
The session storage provided methods for reading, writing and clearing the session data

// Save data to sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");

// Get saved data from sessionStorage
let data = sessionStorage.getItem("key");

// Remove saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.removeItem("key");

// Remove all saved data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.clear();
