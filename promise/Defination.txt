What is a promise
A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved (i.e. rejected, that means for example, due to a network error). It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.

The syntax of Promise creation looks like below,

const promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  // promise description
});
The usage of a promise would be as below,

const promise = new Promise(
  (resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("I'm a Promise!");
    }, 5000);
  },
  (reject) => {}
);

promise.then((value) => console.log(value));


Why do you need a promise
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They provide an alternative approach for callbacks by 
reducing the callback hell and writing the cleaner code.

What are the three states of promise
Promises have three states:

Pending: This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
Fulfilled: This state indicates that the specified operation was completed.
Rejected: This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.
