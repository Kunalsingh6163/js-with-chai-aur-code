What are lambda expressions or arrow functions
An arrow function is a shorter/concise syntax for a function expression and does not have its own this, 
arguments, super, or new.target. These functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

Some of the examples of arrow functions are listed as below,

const arrowFunc1 = (a, b) => a + b; // Multiple parameters
const arrowFunc2 = a => a * 10; // Single parameter
const arrowFunc3 = () => {} // no parameters
