What are arrow functions and how do they differ from regular functions?

Let's look at the key features of arrow functions and how they differ from traditional functions in JavaScript.

Arrow Functions: Key Features
Concise Syntax:

Especially useful for short, one-liner functions.
No need for function keyword or braces if there's a single expression.
Implicit Return:

When there's no explicit { return ... ;} statement, arrow functions return the result of the single expression inside.
this Binding:

Does not have its own this. It's "inherited" from the surrounding (lexical) context. This feature is known as 'lexical scoping'.
Code Example: Standard Function vs. Arrow Function
Here is the JavaScript code:

// Standard Function
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

// Arrow Function
const greetArrow = name => "Hello, " + name + "!";
In the code above, greet is a standard function, while greetArrow is an arrow function, showcasing the 
difference in syntax and required keywords.

When to Use Arrow Functions
Event Handlers: Ideal for concise, inline event handling, where this context can be inherited from the lexical scope.

Callback Functions: Useful for array methods like map, filter, and reduce.

Avoidance of this Redefinition: When you want to maintain the surrounding context of this and avoid unintended redefinition.

Code Example: Arrow Function and this Context
Here is the JavaScript code:

// Using traditional functions
document.getElementById('myButton').onclick = function() {
  console.log('Button clicked:', this);  // Refers to the button element
};

// Using arrow functions
document.getElementById('myButton').onclick = () => {
  console.log('Button clicked:', this);  // Refers to the global/window object
};
In the arrow function example, the context of this does not refer to the button element, but to the global window object, 
because arrow functions do not have their own binding of this. Instead, they inherit this from their lexical scope, 
which in this case is the global context.
