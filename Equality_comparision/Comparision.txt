What is the difference between == and ===?
Strict equality (===) in JavaScript requires both value and type to match, testing for more specific conditions and reducing the likelihood of unexpected results.

In contrast, the abstract equality comparison (==) can lead to type coercion, potentially causing counterintuitive outcomes.

While both comparison modes test value equality, === ensures an additional match of data type.

Illustrative Example: Abstract vs. Strict Equality
Abstract Equality:
5 == '5' evaluates to true because JavaScript converts the string to a number for comparison.
Strict Equality:
5 === '5' evaluates to false because the types are not the same.
Key Considerations
Type Safety: === is safer as it avoids unwanted type conversions.
Performance: === can be faster, especially for simple comparisons, as it doesn't involve type coercion or additional checks.
Clarity: Favoring === can make your code clearer and more predictable.
Common Best Practices
Use Strict Equality by Default: This approach minimizes unintended side effects.
Consider Type Coercion Carefully: In specific cases or with proven understanding, == can be suitable, but be cautious about potential confusion.
Code Example: Equality Operators
Here is the JavaScript code:

// Abstract equality
console.log('5' == 5);      // true
console.log(null == undefined);  // true
console.log(0 == false);    // true

// Strict equality
console.log('5' === 5);     // false
console.log(null === undefined); // false
console.log(0 === false);   // false
