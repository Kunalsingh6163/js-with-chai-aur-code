Destructuring in JavaScript is a syntax that allows you to extract values from arrays or properties 
from objects and assign them to variables in a concise manner. 
This makes your code more readable and less verbose.

Array:-> In array destructuring, the position of elements in the array determines which values are assigned to the variables.

Object:-> In object destructuring, the names of the properties are used to extract the corresponding values.

Benefits of Destructuring
1. Reduces boilerplate code.
2. Makes variable assignment from complex objects and arrays more straightforward.
3. Allows default values for variables during destructuring.
4. Supports skipping and collecting remaining elements or properties.
