JavaScript localStorage is a web storage feature that allows you to store key-value pairs in a browser. 
Data persists even after the browser is closed, providing a method to save and retrieve data across 
sessions, enhancing user experience by maintaining state and preferences.

syntax:--->  ourStorage = window.localStorage;

Key Features of localStorage
1. Origin-Bound Storage: Data is stored per domain and is not shared across different origins.
2. Persistent Storage: Data remains intact even if the browser is closed or the operating system is rebooted. 
                       It will be available until manually cleared.
3. Storage Limit: The storage limit for localStorage is 5MB, which is greater than the 4MB limit for cookies.
4. No Automatic Transmission: Unlike cookies, localStorage data is not sent with every HTTP request, 
                              making it a more efficient option for client-side storage.
